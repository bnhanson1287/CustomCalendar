# Customer Calendar Scheduling Android App

This app has a custom calendar view which indicates dates where appointments are scheduled. The user has the ability to insert, update, and delete appointments and clients. The clients are kept in a "phonebook". The phonebook stores the clients name and phone number. When the phone number is selected by the user, the phone number is sent to the phone app within the phone allowing the user to phone that client.
